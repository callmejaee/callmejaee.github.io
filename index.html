   Explaining Mental Disorders
  </H1>
  <P>
    Hi my name Joclyn hunt I am a sophomore at towers high school. I am 16 years old. I consider myself a pretty decent person. My friends would describe me as 
    funny, sarcastic, honest, and an overall happy person most of the time(and yes I asked). What most of my friends don’t realize is I suffer from major anxiety
    and depression. I am bipolar and also have bpd(borderline personality disorder). 
    </P>

      The purpose of this website is to help educate people on what mental health disorders are and help people understand each one. There aren’t signs in every person,
      you won’t always know someone is struggling until they say something. This is to help people like me to understand what certain issues are because it took me
      forever to actually go to a doctor and actually describe how I was feeling. This is not for self diagnosing because a lot of these can look the same and get 
      confusing. Please see a actual doctor or psychiatrist if you believe you are struggling with mental health issues  
    </P>
